      HACK: Redirect to index.html

      When an user enters a location in the URL bar, they get served this page
      with a 404 error because there is no actuall file at that location (this
      is a SPA). So we solve that problem, by storing the requested location,
      redirecting to index.html using a meta refresh tag (which is treated the
      same as 301 redirect by crawlers) and then finally restoring the location
      at the start of index.html.
    -->
    <script>
      sessionStorage.setItem('redirect', location.href);
    </script>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/"></meta>
